# HF-PCAL95555 Documentation

Welcome! This directory contains step-by-step guides for installing, building, and using the **HF-PCAL95555** library -- a hardware-agnostic C++ driver for the **PCA9555** and **PCAL9555A** 16-bit I/O expanders.

The driver auto-detects which chip variant is connected and enables features accordingly. Standard PCA9555 features work on both chips; PCAL9555A-only features (pull resistors, drive strength, input latch, interrupt mask/status, output mode) degrade gracefully on a PCA9555.
